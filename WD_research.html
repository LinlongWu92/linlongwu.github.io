The essence of radar systems across various applications is to swiftly and accurately perceive the environment, a capability that is directly and significantly influenced by the transmitted waveform. Advancements in radar hardware, such as ADCs</i>DACs, DSPs, and antenna technology, have made the implementation of complex waveforms feasible, pushing the boundaries of what radar systems can achieve.</p>

<div class="blockcontent">
<p>Designing effective waveforms involves a multi-dimensional, multi-domain approach, considering parameters such as amplitude, 
phase, frequency, time, polarization, code, and spatial characteristics. This approach seeks optimal solutions within a feasible 
set defined by hardware limitations, application scenarios, and user-defined preferences. By leveraging these degrees of freedom (DoF), 
radar waveform design addresses complex challenges and enables innovative solutions that enhance radar capabilities among various applications.</p>
<p>Towards the future, leveraging large datasets and machine learning to optimize waveforms, integrating deep learning with traditional signal processing for real-time optimization, 
and combining different sensing modalities will create more robust and versatile systems. 
This evolution will enable next-generation radar systems to meet modern demands, ensuring robust, adaptive, and high-performance capabilities across various fields.</p>
